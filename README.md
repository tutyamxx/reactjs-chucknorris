♻️ Playing with React.js to fetch some simple API jokes

# Whaaat?

## Basically this small project shows understanding of new React.js coding style and:

- Passing `methods` and `props` to other components
- Reusable components
- Use of animations
- Use of hooks `useEffect` (and its dependencies, if any?) to gather data and `useState` for `states`
- Use of `react-router-dom`
- Use of new React.js coding style without bloating classes

# Run

- `npm install` and `npm start`
